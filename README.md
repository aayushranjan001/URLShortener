# URLShortener

A URL Shortener web application created using Spring, Java, MySql, JSP, HTML & CSS


When a long URL is entered a corresponding short URL is generated. The short URL is generated using a unique integer id from the database and converts the integer id to a sequence of characters (a-zA-Z0-9).
The short URL is then stored in the database and when the short URL is entered in the browser, it redirects to the long URL.

The CSS used is taken from https://codepen.io/yasminzy/pen/MOrwJa.
